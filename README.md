# CrawLer - V.1
This program indexes cl-sektionen.se and creates an interactive sitemap with networkx and pyvis. Links from the nav bar and footer are only counted from the home page. News articles are not indexed.

## Why is this useful?
This can be used to decide how accessible a page is and what paths users can take to a certain page from the home page.

__Requirements__
- pip install bs4
- pip install networkx
- pip install matplotlib
- pip install pyvis

__Run from VS code__
